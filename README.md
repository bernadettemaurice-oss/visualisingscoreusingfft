# visualisingscoreusingfft
> This project uses a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to visualise the frequency and amplitude of an imported SoundFile. The SoundFile is the piece 'Mia and Sebastian's Theme' from the 2016 film La La Land being played on piano. This project was adapted from Noah Hradek on [ Medium ](https://medium.com/@noahhradek/making-a-frequency-visualizer-in-processing-e3750c699a7b)

## General Information
This project falls under the artistic challenge category. I really love the score from this film and wanted to see how the code languages of music and java in processing could intersect to create a piece of visual art. This project evolved as the semester progressed, with this initially being planned as a soundwave style drawing, but through research was inspired to add a technical aspect to this project, finding I could measure the frequency and amplitude of a SoundFile in processing. I was excited to learn more about how sound is visualised in different ways using processing and do my own experimentation in processing to develop my skills using the program. 


## Coding Environment
Though I had initially planned to use both Processing and TunePad, I decided to challenge myself differently by recording myself playing the piece instead of developing it in TunePad, bringing this outside skillset into the coding environment. I then used Processing to create my visualisation, inputting the SoundFile into the existing source code. Using Processing's Sound Library, as well as Processing in Java, Processing was able to visualise the frequency and amplitude of the SoundFile. I challenged myself by implementing a few stretch goals to change the visualisation's shape and colour.

## Features
The SoundFile input using code
The FFT visualiser creating frequency bands, which were adjusted using...
The colours reflecting the film's colour palette, adjusted using....

## Setup
This project didn't require much setup. Once I downloaded the processing sound library and inputted the source code, the FFT visualiser was able to run. All I needed was an mp3 to input into the project.

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired from Noah Hradek on [ Medium ](https://medium.com/@noahhradek/making-a-frequency-visualizer-in-processing-e3750c699a7b). I also used a few other resources to help me to import my SoundFile and implement my stretch goals. I used Processing's online resources, as well as resources from YouTube. To import my SoundFile, I used a tutorial from [John McCaffrey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6fG1wneXWo), which was particularly helpful. I also used the feedback from my peers and tutor during tutorials to troubleshoot issues and advance my project.
